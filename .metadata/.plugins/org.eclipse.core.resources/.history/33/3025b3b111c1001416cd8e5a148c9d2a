Program: AverageRain.java
Author: Mike
Date: 3-2-2015
Purpose:
Create a class that reads from a file that holds 12 real numbers. The numbers represent the amount of 
rainfall in inches for each of the 12 months last year. The first token in the file represents 
January’s rainfall, the second token represents February’s rainfall and so on. Store the names of the 
months in an array of strings. Store the rainfall amounts in a parallel array of real numbers. The 
program should determine and display:
	1.	 The total rainfall for the year
	2.	The average rainfall per month
	3.	The month with the highest rainfall amount
	4.	The month with the lowest rainfall amount
You may choose to create a method to perform each of the determinations.
